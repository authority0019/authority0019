 #--Important Disclaimer--#

 I want to emphasize that I am not responsible for any illegal activities that may arise from the use of my code. Please be aware that  
 certain codes may not function as intended.


 #--Ethical Use of Tools--#
 
 It is crucial to use my tools, as well as those created by others, responsibly and ethically. Engaging in any harmful activities against 
 computers or software without explicit permission is not only unethical but also constitutes a serious crime, which can lead to significant 
 legal consequences.


 #--Final Note--#
 
 Always prioritize integrity and respect in your coding practices. Thank you for your understanding. Feel free to adjust any part of it to 
 better fit your style!
